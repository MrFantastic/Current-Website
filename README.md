# Current-Website
This website is for a basic website-building class and is still ongoing. Some functionality is still missing and more pages are soon to be added that will showcase more aspects of web design. This website is hosted
on AWS using an S3 bucket connected to Cloudfront using Route 53 that has Certificate Manager connected as well to give HTTPS as opposed to HTTP.
